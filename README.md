## Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma dev
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser**

## Railway Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Railway account
- GitHub repository

### Deploy Steps

1. **Connect your GitHub repo to Railway:**
   - Go to [Railway](https://railway.com)
   - Click "Deploy Now" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository

2. **Add PostgreSQL database:**
   - In your Railway project dashboard
   - Click "Add Service" â†’ "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
   - Railway will automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   Railway will automatically detect and set most variables, but ensure:
   - `DATABASE_URL` is set (auto-configured with PostgreSQL addon)
   - `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` (auto-configured)

4. **Deploy:**
   - Railway will automatically build and deploy your app
   - Your app will be available at `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### Database Migration on Railway

The app will automatically run `prisma generate` during the build process. For the initial deployment, Railway will need to run the database migration:

1. In Railway dashboard, go to your service
2. Open the "Settings" tab
3. Add a custom start command: `npx prisma migrate deploy && npm start`

Or manually run the migration after deployment:
```bash
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | Auto-set by Railway |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode | `production` |

## API Endpoints
